## This is the frontend repository of the project

### The Process
The homepage of the application shows the ad of Hotstar for IPL 2020 to connect with the IPL 2020 theme (COVID-19). After you scroll down you'll see 2 column layout (which collapses to one column in smaller devices) in which one column has MS Dhoni picture and another column having some fun facts about IPL and 2 links to navigate to stats page and trivia page. At bottom, there's a footer containing sponsors of IPL 2020 which is also responsive.

The stats page requests the backend using Fetch API to fetch data to plot into a graph and table.

The trivia page requests the backend and renders all the fun facts about IPL
